# Dataset Management and Basic Analysis System

This project was developed as part of the GSE301 Python Programming assignment.

## Description
The program reads numerical and categorical data from files, performs basic statistical analysis (total, average, minimum, maximum), checks performance based on a threshold, extracts unique categories using sets, and saves the results into a report file.

## Features
- File handling (reading and writing files)
- Error handling for missing and invalid data
- Functions and loops for calculations
- Conditional statements for performance evaluation
- Use of sets to extract unique categories
- Object-Oriented Programming using a DataSet class

## How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Ensure the following files are in the same folder:
   - dataset_analysis.py  
   - numbers.txt  
   - categories.txt  
3. Run the program using:
